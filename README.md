# Word-MHRA-Citation-Style
A custom citation/bibliography style for Microsoft Word 2016 to allow use of Word's citation/bibliography features for the MHRA referencing style. This style is a revision of a style originally created by Yves Dhondt (yves.dhondt@gmail.com) and based on version 2.1 of the BibWord stylesheet, aiming to bring the style both to Word 2016 (Office 365) and to update it to match the 3rd edition (2013) of the MHRA style guide.

# Installation & use
1. Download or clone the repository to `%appdata%/Roaming/Microsoft/Bibliography/Style`
2. Select `MHRA - Footnote` as your `Style` within the `References` top-bar

# A Note of Caution
Word's bibliography definition documents (like this one) are filled with provisions for lots of edge-cases. I will attempt to identify and correct these as I encounter them, but I can give no guarentee it will always produce the right result. Please double-check, and if you notice something wrong you can submit an issue: I'll try and keep things up-to-date as best I can!

Always check your own work thoroughly - I give no guarentee that this style is 100% correct, but hopefully it will speed up your referencing process nonetheless.
